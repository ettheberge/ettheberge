# Introduction #

Hello, reader! My name is Emilie Th√©berge, and I recently finished my MSc. in Medical Genetics at UBC. You may read my thesis [here](), titled: "Investigating sex differences in the polygenic risk of major depressive disorder and shared associations with cardiovascular disease". Currently I work as clinical research coordinator in a few heart disease studies at VGH, and am applying for medical schools.

## This repo #

I will eventually be putting some code and other materials on here from my thesis work. Stay tuned!

Otherwise, I made an "Intro to Coding" repo aimed at beginners who are just stepping into the computational world with the aim to analyze data - but not knowing the languages yet, or where to start. So, I made this resource to hopefully be a helpful "launch pad" from which people could individualize their own learning journeys - if you're one of those people, I hope you find it helpful!
