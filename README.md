# Introduction #

Hello, reader! My name is Emilie Th√©berge - currently a MSc. student in UBC's Medical Genetics Program.
I'm co-supervised by [Dr. Jessica Dennis](https://twitter.com/JessicaKDennis) and [Dr. Wendy Robinson](https://twitter.com/wprobins27), and I can be found between their labs at BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHRI). 

## My Research #

For my Master's thesis, I am investigating sex differences in polygenic risk of depression subtypes and shared associations with cardiovascular disease. 

Depression is complex and heterogeneous, and there are a number of ways to subtype it - I'd refer to this excellent paper from [Cai et al. (2019)](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/29/R1/R10/5860824) to get introduced to this trait's complexity, if you're interested. Cardiovascular disease is a broad term, and I am going to be investigating outcomes (ie. myocardial infarction, "heart attacks") typically associated with coronary artery disease.
