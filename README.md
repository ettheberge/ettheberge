# Introduction #

Hello, reader! My name is Emilie Th√©berge, and I recently finished my MSc. in Medical Genetics at UBC. You may read my thesis [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0416545), titled: "Investigating sex differences in the polygenic risk of major depressive disorder and shared associations with cardiovascular disease". Currently I work as clinical research coordinator in a few heart disease studies at VGH, and am applying to medical school with a long-term goal to advocate for the integration of genomics research ("precision health medicine") and sex/gender-differences-aware research into practice as a clinician-scientist. More details in my LinkedIn [here](www.linkedin.com/in/emilietheberge).

## This repo #

I will eventually be putting some code and other materials on here from my thesis work. Stay tuned!

Otherwise, I made an "[Intro to Coding](https://github.com/ettheberge/Coding_Intro)" repo aimed at beginners who are just stepping into the computational world with the aim to analyze data - but not knowing the languages yet, or where to start. So, I made this resource to hopefully be a helpful "launch pad" from which people could individualize their own learning journeys - if you're one of those people, I hope you find it helpful!

I was also invited as a guest workshop speaker at the first year's round of [Precision Health Initiative Workshops](https://github.com/Phillip-a-richmond/PrecisionHealthVirtualEnvironment/tree/main/Workshops) led by Dr. Phil Richmond at the BCCHR, full details here, where I co-led a workshop about how to investigate and analyze SNP data.
